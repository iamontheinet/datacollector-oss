What is StreamSets Data Collector?
----------------------------------

StreamSets Data Collector is an enterprise grade, open source, continuous big data ingestion platform.
It has an advanced and easy to use GUI that lets data engineers, data scientists, developers and data infrastructure
teams easily create data pipelines in a fraction of the time typically required to create complex ingest scenarios.
Out of the box, StreamSets Data Collector reads from and writes to a large number of connectors, including Amazon S3, Microsoft ADLS, Google cloud, JDBC-based, Hadoop and file-based, Kafka, and many others. In addition to a large number
of pre-built stages to transform and process the data on the fly, you can also use Groovy, Jython, and JavaScript processors to write custom code.
